# Housing-Price-Prediction-Analysis
Developed model to predict top five investment locations in the USA based on historic housing and income data using Pyspark and various machine learning tools.

Purpose: The purpose of this repository is to document the Machine Learning project  on reviewing the data around average home sales/roi and census data to help users determine the best location (zip) and type of housing to invest in.

To use the code you should first download the Redfin Housing Market Data 2012-2021 into your google drive. Shared Google Drive link provided Data is provided by Kaggle.com Redfin Housing Market Data 2012-2021 US housing market data 2012-2021 by different geographical region Use the below link to download the zip_code_market_tracker.tsv000 https://www.kaggle.com/thuynyle/redfin-housing-market-data?select=zip_code_market_tracker.tsv000 shared file location on google drive https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b-Z0Tt--ioLGhPTNwHVKyYY7mS7ynRJs/view?usp=sharing

We included both the original data exploration file and the ML model file which includes our actual model.

For using the exact line of code from repository to read the Refin data, after downloading the data set in the local computer from Kaggle You need to create a folder named "data" in the google drive and manually upload the data set in that "data" folder. or modify the file path in the correct read.csv(line

2nd Data Set from US Federal Census: American Community Survey Code for requesting the API and read the data in the Getting Census Data File is in the Collab Notebook
